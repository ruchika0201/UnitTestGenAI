# UnitTestGenAI

**UnitTestGenAI** is a Python script that leverages the OpenAI API to automatically generate unit tests for TypeScript files. 
Writing unit tests can be a time-consuming and error-prone process, but with the power of artificial intelligence, UnitTestGenBot streamlines the task, making test-driven development more efficient and reliable.

## Features

- **Automatic Test Generation:** UnitTestGenBot automatically creates unit tests for TypeScript functions and methods, ensuring comprehensive test coverage.

- **Intelligent Test Cases:** The generated test cases are designed with the help of AI, providing meaningful assertions and edge case coverage for thorough testing.

- **Seamless Integration:** The Python script seamlessly integrates with your TypeScript projects, making it easy to incorporate generated tests into your codebase.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/UnitTestGenBot.git
```
2. Install the necessary Python libraries and dependencies.
3. Configure your OpenAI API key
4. Provide TypeScript files in the folder in which the script is going to run.
5. Run the script with folder name as the argument
```bash
python script.py <sourceFolder>
```

## Usage
